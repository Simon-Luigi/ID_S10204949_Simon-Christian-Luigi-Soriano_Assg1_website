# PS5: Built Different

My project is dedicated to the latest console that has been released, the PlayStation5, or PS5 for short. The intent of the user audience is to learn more about the details about the upcoming release of the PS5. For example, users can find out about the various features that the PS5 provides as well as the upcoming games that will come along with it. The website is also created to attract potential new fans of Sony who have never played any of their consoles before so with the help of this website, it will help to smoothly transistion newer Sony fans into the world of the Playstation console as they purchase their first Playstation console. For current fans of Sony, as they have more information about the upcoming PS5, it will give them a clearer idea about whether they want to purchase the PS5 or not and if they are going to purchase the PS5, they also can decide which version of the PS5 they want to purchase, whether it be the digital edition or the standard edition. The main focus of the creation of this website is to boost sales of the new PS5 aswell as to create 'hype' amongst the gaming audience so that the PS5 can be further made aware through different forms of media whether be it through word of mouth, through news article reporting the upcoming PS5 because of this website, etc.

## Design Process

I created this website with the intention to advertise the upcoming release of the PS5 which is coming on 17th November in Singapore. When I thought of what I should include in the website, I immediately thought of details of the console that the user wants to know. As I feel as I am part of the targeted audience, which are gamers, it helped me to think of the various sections that I feel would be useful in the website that would appeal to fans of the playstation. I did not forget about potential fans of the PS5 as I also gave thoughts from their point of view on what they want to see when stumbling across this website. For example, the first thing I have thought of is a video section that is made by the official Playstation youtube channel that showcases what the PS5 will look like and also showcase the gameplay using the playstation. By doing so, it will gather people's attention and give them a small taste on what the PS5 brings to the table. I also made the website into a long page rather than a page with different HTML sections as I feel that from a user's perspective, it is much easier to scroll down to view the sections of my PS5 website rather than getting irritated to click on a specific section to head to that part of the website. Furthermore, it is also better for mobile users as I believe that as mobile users, we prefer scrolling rather than tapping due to its efficiency. But of course, I still had to add a navigation page so that users can jump to a specific part of a page if they want too. After that, I thought of a section that shows the upcoming games so as to intrigue users on what games the PS5 has to offer, using pictures from the different upcoming games of the PS5. Following up, I want to also show what kind of experience the PS5 can provide to users so I chose to add a section that lists down the features of the gameplay of the PS5 such as 4K display or 120 frames-per-second (fps) gameplay with imagery to make the features more outstanding. As I feel that it is pivotal for users to know the pricings of the PS5 so I included the pricing of the two types of PS5 consoles the users can choose, which is the PS5 standard edition which has the blue-ray disc player as well as the PS5 digital edition which is cheaper but users can only play games virtually and cannot insert any PS5 discs. I also included what benefits does the different type of console provides so that users can be more informed on what kind of PS5 they want to buy depending on various factors such as their budget/wifi speed to download games online,etc and make a smart purchase. Lastly, but not the least, for those who wants to buy the console if they are convinced with the help of this website, I have thought of a preorder form button with a catchy title to get them to preorder the console. Alongside the preorder form button, I wanted to insert the release date to go along with it to give users an idea on when the PS5 is officialy gonna release so that one can mark their calenders as the PS5 is shipped to them or they get it at their local electronic or gaming retail store. As users click the pre order form, I wanted it to be a seperate page where it leads them to a new HTML site that is dedicated for them to fill up the form. I want to extract important information from the user that relates to preordering the PS5 such as the user's name, email, what type of PS5 to buy,etc. I felt that the credit card billing information would require java script so the button leads to no where as I haven't learnt about JS yet during the time the project starts and end. I have created a low-fidelity website that turns all my ideas into a 'skeleton' to show what the general idea of the website should look like which is inside the GitHub repository.
